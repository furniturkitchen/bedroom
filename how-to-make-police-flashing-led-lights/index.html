Awesome Effect Police LED Light Flasher Circuit TechSaw From techsawco.com
Hello friends, in this project, we will make police lights by using arduino. Now observe the led’s, red led’s flashes 3 times and blue led’s flashes 3 times and this process repeats. Using scissors or a razor blade, make a small hole or slit through the middle of the copper tape that’s connected to the battery negative. The leds are forced to flash at a rapid rate (adjustable) simultaneously as they shift sequentially at the outputs of the ic 4017.
