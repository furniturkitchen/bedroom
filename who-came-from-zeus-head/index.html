A Monumental Marble Bust of Zeus or Asklepios, the Head Roman Imperial From pinterest.com
Athena is born from zeus&#39;s forehead as a result of him having swallowed her mother metis, as he grasps the clothing of eileithyia on the right; Athena, the goddess of wisdom and strategy, emerged fully formed from the head of zeus—if you believe greek mythology, anyhow. Zeus came to lust after metis, and chased her in his direct way. Athena began growing inside zeus’s head.
