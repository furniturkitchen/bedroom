When the power supply to an led is switched off, the light output stops instantly. If the wiring in your home is terrible, it can also cause your led lights to flicker. A good solution has been to pigtail a surface mount single box to the last led light on the circuit, and inside wire a pigtail base to accommodate a small incandescant appliance bulb. The reason for this can usually be found in the electrical wiring.
