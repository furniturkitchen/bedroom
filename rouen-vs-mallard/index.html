Rouen or Mallard? BackYard Chickens From backyardchickens.com

The blue gene has been introduced to the basic mallard pattern, so that these rouen now follow the same colour series as the mallard. A rouen is at least three times the weight of a mallard. The standard rouen is a massive duck that reaches weights between 9 and 10 pounds.
