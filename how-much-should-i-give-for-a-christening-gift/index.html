The amount of money to give in cash or to spend on a child’s christening gift is highly subjective, often ranging from $10 to $100, with $50 as a median amount to shoot for. $50 is an excellent gift for such an occasion, but if you can afford more, go for it. It is not uncommon for people to spend anywhere from $20 to $200 on a baptism gift, with the average being around $50. If you are a couple and know them well, a joint gift of £100 to £150 might be expected.
