The United States Senate was explicitly designed to be undemocratic. From milforddailynews.com

Political power is the social force that allows an individual to organize and mobilize others, influence them to believe and behave, and to gain control over them in a particular society. There is no direct equivalent of the speaker in the senate, and is less committee and rules. This makes people ask, is the senate more powerful than the house?
